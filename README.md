# Nine Lives - Platformer Game

## Overview  
**Nine Lives** is a platformer where you play as a cat with only 9 lives to survive three levels of hazards, enemies, and tricky platforming. The goal is to collect all the stars in each level while avoiding or defeating enemies. There are no health pickups—lose all 9 lives, and it's game over.

## Why This Project?  
This game was developed to experiment with classic platformer mechanics while adding a unique challenge: limited lives across multiple levels. It explores player persistence, strategic movement, and risk-reward decision-making in a simple yet engaging way.
